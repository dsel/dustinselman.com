Picked this bad boy up off of craigslist the other day. It needs some love and thought it would be a good project. It a [Gay 90's](http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=989) William's machine from 1970. It's entirely Electromechanical and has no solid state components. Solenoids and cams and switches, oh my!

Just getting started on cleaning up the score reels and checking all the fuses, etc. After adjusting the score switches I had it fully working for a whole 30 seconds before one of the reels got stuck and killed everything. <br>

  <li>Finish cleaing all the score reels so they turn smoothly</li>
  <li>Double check that all the score switches are aligned properly</li>
  <li>Clean all the surfaces with Novus</li>
  <li>Rig for free play</li>
  <li>Fix/replace chipped paint on the back glass</li>
</ul>
